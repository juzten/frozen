      <h3><code>TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable</code></h3>
<p>Have you ever received the error: <code>TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable</code> when trying to iterate over a variable. Well that's because you're trying to iterate over a variable that is set to None instead of a list.</p>
<p>This is a solution I found when trying to loop over a variable that could either be a list of items or the variable could be set to None. It feels a lot more pythonic than having to check if the variable is a list before looping over it. This was specifically happing when getting back data from sqlalchemy queries. The query can either return a list of items it found in the database or it can return None if nothing is found.</p>
<p>This is an sqlalchemy query, it will either return a list of people with the first_name of 'Justin' or if there is no person with that first name it will return None. This is just an example of when a variable might be a list with list items or None.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>people = Person.query.filter_by(first_name=&#39;Justin&#39;).all()
</pre></div>


<p>I'm going to specifically set <code>people</code> to None here to show that <code>people</code> is actually None instead of having to look into what the above query actually returns.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>people = None
</pre></div>


<p>If <code>people</code> was a list that contained items, the print statements in the for loop would be called. Since <code>people</code> is set to None, nothing will be printed because the empty list in the 'or []' section is what gets evaluated.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>for person in people or []:
    print(person.first_name)
    print(person.last_name)
</pre></div>


<h3>Unlrelated comprehension equivalent but same concept</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>result = [do_something(item) for item in a_list() or []]
</pre></div>
    </div>
